# Erypto

**Erypto** is an open-source project developed by [Nguyen-Phong-211](https://github.com/Nguyen-Phong-211). This project focuses on cryptography solutions, security, and practical implementations of cryptographic techniques in software applications.

> **Note:** This version of Erypto is a Windows Forms (WinForms) application, providing a graphical interface for cryptographic operations.

## Objectives

- Provide secure and user-friendly cryptographic algorithms.
- Support encryption, decryption, digital signing, and verification.
- Enable practical applications for data protection, user authentication, and secure information transmission.

## Key Features

- **Encryption & Decryption:** Supports popular algorithms such as AES, RSA, ECC, etc.
- **Digital Signing & Verification:** Create and verify digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity.
- **Key Management:** Generate, store, and manage secret/public keys.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use WinForms GUI for all functions.
- **Integration Ready:** Can be easily integrated into other .NET applications if required.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python (version 3.10 or higher) - WinForm
- **Libraries:** Utilizes well-known cryptography libraries such as `System.Security.Cryptography` and others depending on project requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nguyen-Phong-211/erypto.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Restore NuGet packages if required.
4. Build and run the WinForms application.

## Usage

After launching the application, you can:
- Encrypt and decrypt text/files using selected algorithms.
- Generate and manage cryptographic keys.
- Digitally sign data and verify signatures.
- Use the graphical interface to interact with all functionalities.
